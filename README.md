# mighty-list-API
a back-end service to persist user data for the-might-list task management app

Local Boot-Up: 
npm install
node index

Note: requires client/mongodb connection to work. Client: https://github.com/itshui3/the_mighty_list_of_stuffs

Current Progression Towards MvP: 

- [ ]  Flatten recursively embedded pages(big goofed on the schema design)
- [ ]  Write board query (compatible w/ root/nested)
- [ ]  Write board mutation (compatible w/ root/nested)
